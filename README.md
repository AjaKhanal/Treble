Youtube is after music bots on Discord. So we are here to fill the void. Introducing Treble, the next generation of Discord music bots! 

Just like Groovy and Rhythm, Treble will play music from YouTube. Just invite the bot to your server and type -play {Youtube URL} to play music. Alternatively, if you donâ€™t want to find the url, you can simply type  -play {song title} and Treble will scrape Youtube and find the closest match using a sophisticated natural language processing algorithm with optimized query prediction.
